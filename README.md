# YouTube_Downloader
## Requeriments
For this simple project you will need install the "pytube" package using pip.  
For more information about the package, other than the comment in the source code, you can find in the [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/ "pytube Official Documentation") official documentation.
  
**NOTE**: First make sure you create a virtual environment just for organization.  
You can find more information about virtual environment at the [python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html "Python Official Documentation - Virtual Environment") offical documentation website.
### For Windows users
<pre>
 pip install pytube
</pre>
### For Linux/Mac users
<pre>
sudo pip3 install pytube
</pre>
## Improvements
The next updates will be to add some variance for the downloader. Test with download parameters, if they exists, and make selection between extention or type (video ou audio).
  
This will take a while since I still have some quiz to take at my college.
